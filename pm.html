                        ​​​​​​​Dear Parents and Students: <br>
                        Welcome to the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year! <br><br>
                        A new school year presents opportunities for various beginnings:
                        new courses, new classrooms, and, of course, new faces. <br><br>
                        At the start of each school year, we are inspired and motivated with a refreshed outlook and renewed spirit.
                        This year I am anxious with anticipation and courage as we continue our journey into important and impactful work concerning the intersection of academic rigor and school culture.
                        I have already begun work with teacher leaders, school administrators,
                        the PTSO, and DCPS central office to create solutions to some of our most pressing academic and social issues.
                        I have great optimism for what we will accomplish during the next school year and beyond.
                        We will continue the efforts of the last few years and shape our work around our core mission,
                        vision, and values: “Wilson High School strives to build a safe, supportive, and welcoming community of dedicated and self-reflective learners, equipped to joyfully embrace opportunities for growth on the path of active citizenship.” 
                        To further drive our decision-making this year, we are using the results of the Panorama Survey, completed by 785 underclass students in the spring of 2019.
                        The survey measures Social Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies. <br>
                        The district has targeted specific questions to create the Loved, Challenged and Prepared Index.
